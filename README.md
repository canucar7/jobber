JOBBER

What is Jobber?

 Jobber is a mobile application designed to make it easier for people to find both jobs and 
employees. By registering once, users can post a job or apply for suitable jobs whenever they 
want. The application displays job advertisements on a map, allowing job seekers to apply for 
the listings in locations they find suitable.

 We use Flutter/Dart for the front-end and mobile part and Laravel for the back-end part of Jobber.
